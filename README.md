# Yoobee-Black-Estate
Black Estate Winery website redesign made for a Yoobee project. Project is in no way associated with Black Estate Winery.


The project was made using VS Code with the Live Sass Complier extension.
The settings for the complier were as follows:
```json
{
    "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [{
        "format": "compressed",
        "extensionName": ".min.css",
        "savePath": "./dist/css"
    }]
}
```

Again, this project is in no way associated with the Black Estate Winery, they own all images and wording.
Please don't hesitate to message me if you have any issues with this.
